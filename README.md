# Black-Litterman model

## Description

The Black-Litterman is a portfolio allocation model that tries to improve the practical application of the modern portfolio theory. 

For an intership project I decided to implement the model using Python in order to simplify the application of the model with different
investor views. Through this, I was able to understand the model and its mathematical peculiarities.

The objective of this implementation is to help analyst apply this model without spending a lot of effort understanding and replicating it.

### Built With
In order to implement the model I used mostly two python modules: NumPy and pandas.
